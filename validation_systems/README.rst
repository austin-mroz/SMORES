Validation
==========

This directory holds the scripts required for the validation of
``SMORES``. Two sets of validation can be performed, the first,
found in common_carbon_substituents__, compares
the ``SMORES`` parameters to sterimol parameters, and ensures
they match for systems where we expect similar results.

The second, found in catalytic_reactions__, also calculates the
``SMORES`` parameters and compares them to sterimol parameters.
However, in this case, the systems are taken from the work of
Harper__ et al.
